# Analyzing-Data-with-Python
 Data Analysis is the technique of collecting, transforming, and organizing data to make future predictions and informed data-driven decisions. It also helps to find possible solutions for a business problem. 
## Importing Datasets
* Analyze Python data using a dataset<br>
* Identify three Python libraries and describe their uses<br>
* Read data using Python's Pandas package<br>
* Demonstrate how to import and export data in Python<br>
## Data Wrangling
* Handling missing values in data<br>
* Formatting data to standardize it and make it consistent<br>
* Normalizing data<br>
* Grouping data values into bins<br>
* converting categorical variables into numerical quantitative variables 
## Exploratory Data Analysis
* Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic descriptive statistical information, such as mean, median, mode, and quartile values, and use that information to better understand the distribution of the data.<br>
* Putting data into groups to visualize the data better<br>
* Use the Pearson correlation method to compare two continuous numerical variables<br>
* Use the Chi-square test to find the association between two categorical variables and how to interpret them
* Use Analysis of Variance(ANOVA) to test whether there are significant differences between the means of two or more groups
## Model Development
* Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression<br>
* Model Evaluation Using Visualization<br>
* Polynomial Regression and Pipelines<br>
* Measures for In-Sample Evaluation<br>
* Prediction and Decision Making<br>
## Model Evaluation and Refinement
* Model Evaluation<br>
* Over-fitting, Under-fitting and Model Selection<br>
* Ridge Regression<br>
* Grid Search<br>
## Final Assignment on housing price data
* Determining the market price of a house<br>
* Analyze and predict housing prices using attributes<br>
