# Analyzing-Data-with-Python
 Data Analysis is the technique of collecting, transforming, and organizing data to make future predictions and informed data-driven decisions. It also helps to find possible solutions for a business problem. 
## Importing Datasets
* Analyze Python data using a dataset<br>
* Identify three Python libraries and describe their uses<br>
* Read data using Python's Pandas package<br>
* Demonstrate how to import and export data in Python<br>
## Data Wrangling
* Handling missing values in data<br>
* Formatting data to standardize it and make it consistent<br>
* Normalizing data<br>
* Grouping data values into bins<br>
* converting categorical variables into numerical quantitative variables 
## Exploratory Data Analysis
* Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic descriptive statistical information, such as mean, median, mode, and quartile values, and use that information to better understand the distribution of the data.<br>
* Putting data into groups to visualize the data better<br>
* Use the Pearson correlation method to compare two continuous numerical variables<br>
* Use the Chi-square test to find the association between two categorical variables and how to interpret them
